# C's Utils
C's Utils is a utility library made mainly for Unity though some features may be used in pure C#.

It contains mainly Quality of Life additions to Unity ranging from something as simple as string formatting to as complex as an inventory system. All aspects of C's Utils are meant to be extensible, meaning you can override and create your own version of most features in this library. Features are mostly aimed towards the 3D aspect of Unity but may be also be used for 2D development.
